; TYPE: SQL Server 2016 Configuration File (for command-line installation)
; DESCRIPTION:
; Inline comments are mostly copied from existing file generated by install wizard, with clarification where necessary.
; I use drive D:\ for data files (MDF), L:\  for transaction logs (LDF), T:\ for TempDB, and X:\ for backups.
; Most other options are "normal", i.e. I don't deal with clustering, Availability Groups, or other exotic things.
; I am only installing the database engine and replication components; see FEATURES option for more.
; Read the corresponding blog post at https://natethedba.wordpress.com/automating-sql-installation/
; USAGE:
; There are THREE static placeholders you need to replace/type when you use this:
; 1. <YOUR UPDATES/PATCHES FOLDER>, which is for slipstreaming whatever service-pack(s) and cumulative-update(s).
; 2-3. <YOUR DOMAIN> and <YOUR DBA GROUP>: for specifying domain account(s) which are given SQL sysadmin ('sa') rights,
; hence, usually your DBA group. You could move that part out to the calling script instead, if you wanted,
; but I chose to leave it here because it's not likely to change much within an environment.

; required first line
[OPTIONS]

; Specifies a Setup work flow, like INSTALL, UNINSTALL, or UPGRADE. This is a required parameter. 
ACTION="Install"

; Specifies that SQL Server Setup should not display the privacy statement when ran from the command line. 
SUPPRESSPRIVACYSTATEMENTNOTICE="True"

; By specifying this parameter and accepting Microsoft SQL Server terms, you acknowledge that you have read and understood the terms of use. 
IACCEPTSQLSERVERLICENSETERMS="True"

; Use the /ENU parameter to install the English version of SQL Server on your localized Windows operating system. 
ENU="True"

; Setup will run silently, logging to files in the setup-boostrap directory
Q="True"

; Specify whether SQL Server Setup should discover and include product updates. The valid values are True and False or 1 and 0. By default SQL Server Setup will include updates that are found. 
UpdateEnabled="False"

; If this parameter is provided, then this computer will use Microsoft Update to check for updates. 
USEMICROSOFTUPDATE="False"

; Specifies features to install, uninstall, or upgrade. The list of top-level features include SQL, AS, RS, IS, MDS, and Tools. The SQL feature will install the Database Engine, Replication, Full-Text, and Data Quality Services (DQS) server. The Tools feature will install shared components. 
FEATURES=SQLENGINE,REPLICATION

; Specify the location where SQL Server Setup will obtain product updates. The valid values are "MU" to search Microsoft Update, a valid folder path, a relative path such as .\MyUpdates or a UNC share. By default SQL Server Setup will search Microsoft Update or a Windows Update service through the Window Server Update Services. 
; UpdateSource="<YOUR UPDATES/PATCHES FOLDER>"

; Displays the command line parameters usage 
HELP="False"

; Specifies that Setup should install into WOW64. This command line argument is not supported on an IA64 or a 32-bit system.

INSTANCENAME="MSSQLSERVER"

; Specify the root installation directory for shared components.  This directory remains unchanged after shared components are already installed. 
INSTALLSHAREDDIR="C:\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server"

; Specify the root installation directory for the WOW64 shared components.  This directory remains unchanged after WOW64 shared components are already installed. 
INSTALLSHAREDWOWDIR="C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft SQL Server"

; Specify the installation directory. 
INSTANCEDIR="C:\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server"

; SQL Agent account startup type
AGTSVCSTARTUPTYPE="Automatic"

; Level to enable FILESTREAM feature at (0, 1, 2 or 3). 
FILESTREAMLEVEL="0"

; Specifies a Windows collation or an SQL collation to use for the Database Engine. 
SQLCOLLATION="SQL_Latin1_General_CP1_CI_AS"

; Set to "True" to enable instant file initialization for SQL Server service. If enabled, Setup will grant Perform Volume Maintenance Task privilege to the Database Engine Service SID. This may lead to information disclosure as it could allow deleted content to be accessed by an unauthorized principal. 
SQLSVCINSTANTFILEINIT="True"

; Windows account(s) to provision as SQL Server system administrators. 
SQLSYSADMINACCOUNTS="tomse"

; The default is Windows Authentication. Use "SQL" for Mixed Mode Authentication.

SQLTEMPDBFILECOUNT="4"

SQLTEMPDBFILEGROWTH="64"

; Specifies the initial size of the Database Engine TempDB log file in MB. 
SQLTEMPDBLOGFILESIZE="1024"

; Specifies the automatic growth increment of the Database Engine TempDB log file in MB. 
SQLTEMPDBLOGFILEGROWTH="64"

; The Database Engine root data directory. 
INSTALLSQLDATADIR="{{installation_path}}"

SQLBACKUPDIR="{{installation_path}}\Backup"

; Default directory for the Database Engine user databases. 
SQLUSERDBDIR="{{installation_path}}\Data"

; Default directory for the Database Engine user database log files. 
SQLUSERDBLOGDIR="{{installation_path}}\Log"

; Directories for Database Engine TempDB files. 
SQLTEMPDBDIR="{{installation_path}}\TempDB"

; Directories for Database Engine TempDB log files. 
SQLTEMPDBLOGDIR="{{installation_path}}/TempDB"
; PS: yes, there is some debate as to whether your TempDB logs should go with your user DB logs, or with your TempDB data;
; I'm inclined to say the latter, because I like to use locally attached NVMe/M.2 flash storage specifically for it. But, YMMV.
